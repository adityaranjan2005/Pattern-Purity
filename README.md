# Pattern-Purity

# Overview

Dark patterns encompass user interface designs strategically implemented on online services to prompt users to act in ways inconsistent with their intended behavior.

In this research, we curated a text-based dataset specifically tailored for the automated detection of dark patterns within the realm of e-commerce websites. Machine learning serves as our baseline for detection.

For the baseline detection, we applied the following two methodologies:

Classical NLP Methods (utilizing Bag-of-Words combined with a Classical Machine Learning Model)
Leveraging transformer-based pre-trained language models (such as BERT)
